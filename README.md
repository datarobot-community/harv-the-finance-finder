# Harv the Finance Finder ðŸ“ˆ

This is a demo application showcasing how to use DataRobot's machine learning products to find and filter items in a financial context.

This is intended as an educational, technology showcase app, uses fake data, and is in no way a recommendation service.

You can also read the accompanying tutorial at DataRobot's developer documentation site: https://api-docs.datarobot.com/docs/finance-finder-batch-predictions.

## Usage

You can access the deployed version at the following link: [harv-the-finance-finder.herokuapp.com](https://harv-the-finance-finder.herokuapp.com).

Alternatively, you can also run it yourself ðŸ‘‡

### Building it yourself

The app is a Flask application with a set of Python scripts to train and deploy a ML model. Follow these steps:

- Have python 3.7 (likely ships with your OS)
- Create virtual environment:
  
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- Create a DataRobot account. You can request a trial at https://datarobot.com/lp/trial. 
- Create an IEX Cloud account (Optional) - they provide financial data. The app comes with pre-generated datasets already.

- Install required dependencies:
  - PostgreSQL
  - Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running 

- Setup environment variables - in an `.env` file in the root directory, replacing the following with your own:

```shell
  POSTGRES_CONNECT="postgresql://DB_USER_NAME:@localhost:5432/DATABASE_NAME"
  IEX_ACCOUNT="YOUR_IEX_PUBLIC_KEY"
  IEX_KEY="YOUR_IEX_SECRET_KEY"
  SKEY="ANY_SECURE_STRING_FOR_FLASK"

  DATAROBOT_API_KEY="YOUR_DR_API_KEY"
  DATAROBOT_URL="YOUR_DR_URL"
```

- For the DataRobot credentials and URL you can find where to find them in our documentation site: https://api-docs.datarobot.com/docs/api-access-guide

- Make sure Postgres is running and you have a database created.

- Run database migrations scripts: `flask db upgrade`
- Seed data in your database: `flask seed_data`
- `flask run` to run the app

- Visit the running app: `https://localhost:5000`

- visit /login -> create user (this should redirect automatically)
- visit /build_portfolio -> pick some stocks (this should redirect to / -> dashboard with suggestions for stocks)
- visit / -> dashboard, select a portfolio, see stocks that are suggested for you

### Steps to deploy on Heroku

You can deploy the app to Heroku.

1. Create new app: `heroku apps:create`
2. Push to git: `git push heroku master`. This will install all dependencies.
3. Add Heroku Postgres as Heroku addon in the dashboard
4. Copy over Postgres config var to `POSTGRES_CONNECT` - by default it's stored as `DATABASE_URL`
5. Run DB migrations: `heroku run "flask db upgrade"`
6. If using the attached dataset: `heroku run "flask seed_data"` - you can also optionally first run the script to generate and load new data. This should take a few minutes. The final message should say "Seed Esgs complete"
7. Set the rest of the environment variables: To run on Heroku you just need `SKEY` - set to anything. This isn't checked, but Flask requires it.
8. Head over to the app that Heroku has deployed.
